# Connect API

Made by @urwrstkn8mare and @aruncancode.

## Use pipenv

1. To use pipenv run
   `python3 -m pip install pipenv && python3 -m pipenv install` or
   `py -m pip install pipenv && py -m pipenv install` on windows
2. Relaunch VSCode.

If the above doesn't work go to: <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv>

## Instructions

1. Copy sensitiveInfoTemplate.json
2. Rename it to sensitiveInfo.json
3. Put in your username and password.
4. Run test.py
5. See the output in output.html

## Todo

- [x] Login to connect.
- [ ] Get the html of a page.
- [ ] Get the javascript in the page to run.
- [ ] Parse it.

## Known Issues

- [ ] It's slow
- [ ] Sometimes it times out and stuff a returned like session has expired.
- [ ] Javascript instead of html (just need to render it.) @urwrstkn8mare is working on this.
