# Connect API

Made by @urwrstkn8mare and @aruncancode.

## Use pipenv

1. [Install pipenv package](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/#installing-pipenv)
2. `cd` into the repository. (eg. `cd connect-api`)
3. run `pipenv install`.

## Instructions

1. Create a copy of the sensitiveInfoTemplate.json file.
2. Rename the copy to sensitveInfo.json
3. Replace the `username` and `password` values with your username and password.
4. Run the test.py with `pipenv run test`

   NOTE: You can run python files with `pipenv run python <python file>`!

## Todo

- [x] Login to connect.
- [x] Get the html of a page.
- [x] Get the javascript in the page to run. @urwrstkn8mare and @aruncancode are working on this
- [ ] Parse it. @aruncancode is working on this
- [ ] Create SQL database to store userdata @aruncancode is working on this
- [ ] Display database information to user via various means eg. Discord, Website, Excel, CLI
      That is something that would use this module but we will work on it anyway.
